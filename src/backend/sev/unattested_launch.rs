//! The `unattested_launch` is an implementation of a so-called "synthetic"
//! or "fake" client that speaks the remote AMD SEV launch protocol. This
//! exists for several reasons:
//!
//!   1.) There is no special-casing in the SEV backend launch process. It
//!       will speak the same protocol for all launch use-cases. The
//!       synthetic client allows us to avoid special-casing any of the launch
//!       code.
//!   2.) The synthetic client allows for keeps to be launched in solitary
//!       environments such as CI or other testing where there are no actual
//!       clients who will participate in the launch protocol.
//!   3.) Sometimes you just want a keep and you don't care to attest.
//!   4.) The synthetic client, as a side-effect, also acts as some degree
//!       of test coverage for the client-side of the remote attestation
//!       protocol.
